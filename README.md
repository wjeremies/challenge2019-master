# The Kryon Challenge
> Put your coding skills and logic to the test

The Kryon Challenge was designed to find the most curious, professional, can-do engineers. The Kryon Challenge demonstrates the challenges our R&D teams face on a daily basis and shows some of our stack and tools when tackling new issues.
In this challenge, we will test standard coding skills (mostly - debugging) as well as logic. Solve it, send your solution, and come meet us.

## Installing / Getting started

In order to run, open the project file using your favourite .net IDE and click the 'Run' button.

Alternatively, you can run directly through CLI:
```
dotnet ./kryon-graphology-challenge/bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.1/kryon-graphology-challenge.dll
```

Oh no, someone left us a piece of broken code! :(
### Stage 1

During the first stage, we will ask you to understand what the program does and what it was originally developed to do.
### Stage 2

Next, we will ask you to **fork the repository**, fix the code and run the program.

### Stage 3

Once the code is fixed and the program is successfuly executed, it will provide with interesting output. At this point, we want you to use logic (and Google, if you need) to solve the final problem.

### Stage 4

That's it! send us your solution with the github repo and your CV to challenge@kryonsystems.com and wait for our call!



## About Kryon

### Our mission
To revolutionize intelligent Robotic Process Automation (RPA) by delivering enterprise customers with a unique full-cycle solution which first discovers business processes and then continuously optimizes them for a seamless, superior RPA experience.

### How it all began
Kryon was born in 2008 out of a desire to help business people perform better. First came Kryon’s application guidance and attended automation. Then, a few technology patents later, enterprises worldwide were turning to Kryon for tools to expedite daily business tasks, cut costs and improve efficiency. One day, a major customer, impressed by our computer vision technology and user-friendly platform, asked if we could automate business processes on virtual machines, not just on user desktops. It was an “aha” moment that spurred the creation of Kryon’s Unattended Automation. Now business users could offload time-consuming tasks to virtual teams. But there was another major chasm we needed to bridge. Until Kryon, automation needed coding and integration. We changed the rules, inventing a more business-user friendly RPA. It’s a characteristic that sets us apart until today.

Our automation solutions are constantly evolving to unlock a company’s potential for growth and high quality performance. Our Hybrid Automation enables virtual and human workforces to work better together, so enterprises can fully automate business processes end-to-end. And, our AI-driven Process Discovery™ solution – an industry innovation – helps organizations identify all the processes they should automate and automatically creates automation workflows in the Kryon Studio.

Today, Kryon’s innovative AI-powered platform is enabling companies to embrace digital transformation. We’re using technology to redefine core parts of business infrastructure for more efficient business operations and work environments.
